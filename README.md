I made a simple web-based tool based according to the specified requirements that I was given. 

If I had more time, I would have changed the method how date of birth is retrieved, because this solution is not fully correct, however it works without any issues.

Everything should work fine. The project was created on VS Express for Web.

The Database was created using Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I have attached DataBase script that should create the table for SSMS.

Additionally, I have attached few screenshots how the web-based tool looks like.
